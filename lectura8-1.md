The article "See What You Want to See: Visual User-Driven Approach for Hybrid Recommendation Parra, D., Brusilovsky, P., and Trattner, C. (2014)." centers the discussion of recommendation systems on user-experience by emphasizing on Human-Computer Interaction opposed to the traditional predictive accuracy focused research on the topic. SetFusion, a visual user-controllable interface is presented as a tool that allows users to tune weights of the different recommender methods that are available on the platform. Specifically, the interface was applied in a conference talk/articles recommendation context.

The perks of the interface are the transparency, explaininability and controllability. The transparency and explainability comes from the fact that the user knows the contribution of each recommendation algorithm via the slider weights, the venn diagram shows the amount of articles that were recommended by each recommendation algorithm and the interaction on the list by hovering and its item's color explains why the article was recommended.
Controllability is obtained by the capacity of the user to modify the weights of the recommendation algorithms in order to improve their search experience and results.

I believe that this kind of interface that blends visualization with 'user-tuning' of the hybrid system is useful on situations where the user has more of a medium to long term relationship with the interface. In the settings were the user takes its time to search and gets to familiarize with the tool, I think the interface is great. On the other side, in contexts where the user has a shorter attention span and wants to directly get accurate recommendations 'out of the box', an interface like this may be considered as clutter by the user, affecting the experience negatively.

As a personal observation, I consider the venn diagram not so user-friendly and intuitive. In this context, it is implied that the users are related to the academia and may have experience with graphs. For them, a venn diagram is simple and easy to understand but if this interface wants to expand in order to reach a more broad and diverse user groups, maybe a graph using an important portion of the interface may not prove to be as useful.

Considering the engagement metrics and their analysis, 
I think that the average time spent in page has a two way interpretation. It can be seen as 'the lower the better' implying a more efficient interaction, or 'the higher the better' implying greater levels of engagement. As I stated before, the interface may work better on situations were the average time spent in page is greater meaning that the average user takes its time on tuning and trying different combinations to get the recommendations he/she wants. There must be a minimum average time spent threshold together with the amount of interaction (clicks, slides, hovering) to consider this visual user-controlled recommendations to be useful.

Finally, there is room to update or improve the recommendations overall considering the user interaction as implicit feedback. As the authors managed to have an extense monitoring of user behavior, the statistics gathered can be used to update and improve not only the interface but also the recommendations, interpreting user attention on an item as a positive feedback to that kind of content.
