# Critique

In the article "Context-Aware Recommender Systems" the concept of context is taken in consideration in the analysis of recommender systems. First, the concept is discussed and it is shown that it can be analyzed from different points of views. Two different views of context are referenced from Dourish (2004): the representational view and interactional view. The first view understands context as a stable, definite form of information while the latter assumes a cyclical relationship between context and activity, thus this view understands context dynamicaly and occasioned opposed to static. Then, context is characterized through its relationship with the recommender system. In terms of the knowledge of the system about contextual factors, context can be classified as observable, partially observable and unobservable. In terms of how contextual factors change through time, context can be classified as static or dynamic.

Three paradigms for using contextual information are presented. The paradigms differentiate between each other mainly on where the contextual information is utilized in the recommendation process. If context is used to filter data prior to its usage on the model, it corresponds to contextual prefiltering. If context is used to filter the model recommendations it corresponds to contextual postfiltering. Finally, if context is used in the model training it corresponds to contextual modeling.

Up to this point, the article worked the topic of context and its application on recommender systems, the last portion of the text is dedicated to the presentation of context aware recommender systems applications like information search, travel guides and music recommendation.

I think that this paper does not dare enough. The only knowledge generated with the article is their three classifications previously described. After the definition of these classifications, there is no much applications to it. Some examples were presented utilizing the vocabulary defined by them (e.g. contextual prefiltering, static/dynamic, etc..) but no main discovery or enlightment is shown regarding context-aware recommender systems. In the last section their main idea is that CARS (context-aware RecSys) is a new research area and it is underexplored with open research problems. The same question presented in the beginning: What is context in recommender systems? is left open. It is a good reading to get introduced to the field of study but it remains shy on proposing hypothesis that require research to support it. For instance, categorizing context as static or dynamic does not venture far enough, and it is one of only three categories presented by the authors. Moreover, no counterarguments are discussed regarding the limits of their categories.

Despite my previous opinion, I do believe their intent to stimulate the readers to get into the topic is achieved. Ideas I came up with are the following:

- It would be interesting to analyze different ensemble methods that blend contextual prefiltering, post filtering and modeling. The design of meta-models that may tune the influence of the different paradigms given different datasets can be explored.

- With the presentation of context-aware recommender systems, there are new ways of capturing users relationships as shared context. For instance, if there is a long term tendency for a group of users on a certain location (such as country or city) to consume a specific group of items, with user-based collaborative filtering, this phenomena can be captured implicitly as some sort of user similarity. This situation on context-aware systems can be modeled using location as a context feature. Trends clusters by location can be precomputed and a contextual modeling paradigm can be utilized so that given a user, its history and its context (location), recommendations can be made taking in account the local trends previously explained. It may be possible to compare how well that phenomena is characterized by either user-based CF or this configuration of context-aware systems.
