In the article "Carousel Personalization in Music Streaming Apps with Contextual Bandits. Bendada, W., Salha, G., & Bontempelli, T. (2020)." the authors present a model for carousel personalization as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. The model captures real-world characteristics through the implementation of cascade-based updates and delayed batch feedback.

The multi-armed bandit with multiple plays is similar to the bandit method in [1] but in every round a subset of more than one arm is selected and in this context, the arms are the items not algorithms. The reward associated to an arm is drawn from a bernoulli distribution. The authors present the trade off between exploration and exploitation. As the rewards of unselected arms is unknown, the system needs to recommend the item first before knowing its reward value. If the system is prone to search for the best arms (exploration) it will select underperforming arms that yield negative results impacting recommendation's quality. If the system tends to avoid 'failing' it will begin to repeatedly select the best ones known by it (exploitation) without venturing on new arms that eventually can be better selections. If the system is conservative, it will exploit. If the system takes risks, it will explore. These behaviors are opposite to each other so the selection of bandit methods and parameters must be made taking this tradeoff in consideration.

The authors realized that running the algorithm independently for every user requires training of K x N parameters which is very large in practice taking in account that streaming platforms like deezer have 40M+ songs (K) and millions of users (N). Considering this problem, two variations of the model are presented. The first one requires user pre-clustering, then the algorithm is run on every cluster giving the same recommendations to users on same clusters. The amount of parameters is reduced to K x Q with Q de amount of clusters. As the number of clusters is much lower than the amount of users, the model complexity is highly reduced. The downside is that the recommendations are semi-personalized as they are given to group of users instead to every user personally. The second method is called contextual multi-armed bandits. The probability of an item being selected is obtained by a logistic regression that resembles the strategy behind matrix factorization models like [2] in which a user-vector on a D-dimensional latent factor space summarizes user preferences and a D-dimensional weight vector to learn for each of the K arms (item). The dot product of those two vectors is calculated and passed through a sigmoid function in order to map it to the bernoulli probability space. The purpose of this method is similar to [2] as it reduces the amounts of parameters significantly. Specifically the number of parameters is reduced to K x N.

In order to capture the characteristics of real world carousels, cascade-based updates and delayed feedback were introduced. Cascade-based updates is a set of considerations over user interactions assuming that the system does not know exactly how many cards were seen by the user. This is due to the fact that there is no explicit feedback of the user wanting to discover additional cards. There are no pages or any sort of index as the user only swipes left and right to see what is available. Delayed feedback is added to the model to simulate real scenarios were data is collected in batches (e.g. at the end of every day) not instantaneously.

As a positive aspect of the article is the diverse selection of algorithms for experimentation. This allowed further analysis and comparison between methods on the results section. On Fig. 2. Different behaviors can be seen regarding exploration and exploitation. Some methods such as etc-seg-exploit is conservative as it only explores 20 rounds and then sticks with the probabilities for each item. Etc-seg-explore flattens its cumulative regret curve on round 80. This means that it considers to have found the optimal set later on the simulation.

Another positive aspect of the article is the the addition of industrial scale A/B testing in order to complement the offline experiments. The data obtained was not explictly presented but on Fig 4. it is shown that the best results were given by ts-seg-cascade having a 15% boost on display-to-stream rates relative to random-top-100 carousel recommendations.

Lastly, the authors aknowledge that the recommendation task they are addressing is relatively new to the field and further research needs to be done in order to develop systems that take in account more variables of real life scenarios. They recognized that they assumed the numbers of users and cards to be fixed through the rounds and that arms and cards distributions are fixed and independent. The last assumption does not allow to work on relevant characteristics of a music recommendation system such as diversity as the playlist relative interest does not depend on the interactions between the items but on the items separately. Having stated this, the authors encouraged the readers to research on this topic and shared their datasets and their code to help researchers to recreate comparable learning problems.
