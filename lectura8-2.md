# Critique

In the article "A user-centric evaluation framework for recommender systems. Pu, P., Chen, L. and Hu, R. (2011)." a questionnaire model called ResQue is presented. It consists of 13 constructs that belong to an evaluation framework on the perceived qualities of recommenders, with a total of 60 Likert scale questions. The constructs are grouped on 4 different sets: User Perceived Qualities, User Beliefs, User Attitudes and Behavioral Intentions.

The first contains three constructs. The first one addresses the overall quality of the recommended items in terms of perceived accuracy, familiarity, novelty, attractiveness, enjoyability, diversity and context compatibility. The second one addresses the interaction adequacy and the last one the interface adequacy. The second set contains the constructs of perceived ease of use, usefulness and control/transparency. The third set deals with the user's overall satisfaction, confidence and trust. The last one takes in consideration the behavioral intentions towards using the system, purchasing, continuance and social influence.

The identification of the several dimensions to study and analize regarding the user experience is detailed and broad. It captures 'logical' appreciations on the questions associated with user perceived qualities to more 'emotional' ones on the questions related to user attitudes. The questionnaire generally has more than one question per construct and it includes reverse scale questions in order to add more support to the related construct. 

I've realized that generally the constructs are either independent or can be hierarchically structured, so it makes sense to separate them as different constructs. In the case of familiarity with novelty I think it occurs the opposite. Considering their definition on those constructs, it may be possible to think familiarity as 1 - novelty in a 0 - 1 scale (the opossite association also applies). Taking this in account, probably omitting one of them would not affect the overall questionnaire's structure. 

The consideration of perceived ease of use is much better than trying to interpret average time spent on the system as an indicator of efficiency and usability. As I explained on the critique of the article "See What You Want to See: Visual User-Driven Approach for Hybrid Recommendation Parra, D., Brusilovsky, P., and Trattner, C. (2014).", the average time spent metric has a two way interpretation. As it may signal efficiency when low or engagement when high, it is much better to ask the user directly how easy was to use the recommendation system.
Also adding perceived initial effort as a separate construct is crucial as an aid to predict user retention, due to the fact that a good first impression leads to a strong customer relationship.
